# DecisionMakerSLR
A decision-making algorithm for NBASLR, a BBGM NBA simulation league.

Currently, this algorithm is on version 2.0.0.

To run the program, download all the files in a folder then run
"decisionmaker.py", the main file for the algorithm.

Credit to tus for creating and refining the importance-defining algorithms. Couldn't
have done it without you!

TODO:

Fix the auto-spreadsheet functions of the program.

The generation of interest might need to be touched, and less linear relationships 
must be used.

Make things look nicer.
